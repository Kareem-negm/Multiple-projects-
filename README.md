In this repo you can see a lot of my private projects there are small projects and very impressive projects 
please if you are interested in one of these projects, let me know, you can contact me through my Email: ***negmkareem38@gmail.com***

in the following lines I will explain each project one by one 


 ### 1 : motion detection in real life :
 
 This is a project used to recognize the fingers of the hand to find the number that the hand refers to using the mediapipe library built by the tensorflow core team

After you know the number that the hand is referring to, we connect it to the Arduino device and install 5 light bulbs.
If a person points a finger at number 1, lamp number 1 will light up, and so on

You can watch a video of the project from [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6791773425556840448/)
