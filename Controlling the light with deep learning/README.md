# Controlling the lighting of lamps by deep learning and computer vision


This is a project used to recognize the fingers of the hand to find the number that the hand refers to using the mediapipe library built by the tensorflow core team

After you know the number that the hand is referring to, we connect it to the Arduino device and install 5 light bulbs.

If a person points a finger at number 1, lamp number 1 will light up, and so on

This project is very useful for people with disabilities and they cannot control the objects around them, all they have to do is indicate the number of the objects that they want to control.
